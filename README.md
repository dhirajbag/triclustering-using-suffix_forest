# triclustering-using-suffix_forest
UG Final Year Project based on Suffix Forest Based Tri-clustering

We introduce a novel data structure called a suffix-forest to design a tri-clustering algorithm. Tri-clustering is a method of unsupervised data analysis used to find patterns of interest in three-dimensional data.
